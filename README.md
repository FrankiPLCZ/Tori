3D Japanese themed game for PC 
Game is about collecting different ghosts and learning new things about them
When u get more ghosts of one type notebook showcases more information about the ghost type 

It's me playing with Unity and testing out it's abbilities 
It's a bugy mess which i will rather not finish due to the fact that it has so many elements that i cannot add URP and i don't like the outcome without it.
Allthough it isn't finished it's fun to play and if someone wants to try it out i would love some feedback
