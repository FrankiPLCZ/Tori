Gameplay is a mix of a parkour-collecting-puzzle. At first you collect ghosts in forest, parkour is on the river's then you go to bamboo forest and when you cross gates you'are given time in which you need to find the ghost, your movement is getting mixed and vision gets blurry. If you don't find the ghost or you go off the trial you are teleported to the gate. After that you go to the temple where is a puzzle you need to complete based on given information in the notebook.

It's me playing with Unity and testing out it's abbilities 
It's a bugy mess which i will rather not finish due to the fact that it has so many elements that i cannot add URP to it and i don't like the outcome without it.
Allthough it isn't finished it's fun to play and if someone wants to try it out i would love some feedback.
